# 11ty React Boilerplate
This is mostly to save myself time, but if anyone else gets any use out of it ðŸŽŠ

Provides a simple starter site that uses 11ty 3.0.0 to render react components, with goober for CSS in JS encapsulation.

Note that this has a relative niave approach to setting the dependencies for the style.css generation (essentially anything matching *.11ty.js will become a dependency)
